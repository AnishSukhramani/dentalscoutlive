    "description": "In outbound.jsx between the heading 'Outbound - Manage and send emails to your practice contacts' and the PST to IST converter, add a live dynamic queue processing status component with attractive UI. It should show: how many entries are already processed, how many emails are left in the emailQueue, how many we selected to process, and an estimated time of completion. When errors occur and queue is not processed fully, alert the user to process the queue to clear it before starting a new batch. The alert should not hinder user operations but should notify that the queue is not empty and not fresh.",
