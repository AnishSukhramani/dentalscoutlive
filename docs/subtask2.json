    "description": "In outbound.jsx between the heading 'Outbound - Manage and send emails to your practice contacts' and the PST to IST converter, add a live dynamic queue processing status component with attractive UI. It should show: how many entries are already processed, how many emails are left in the emailQueue, how many we selected to process, and an estimated time of completion. When errors occur and queue is not processed fully, alert the user to process the queue to clear it before starting a new batch. The alert should not hinder user operations but should notify that the queue is not empty and not fresh.",

    "description": "In Templates and IDs component when the create or edit components are being used I want to add a feature where you can use [column name] to indicate a placeholder to insert the corresponding column value of that entry. Example if my email body text says: 'Hello, [first name] ! How are you?' Then for each email sent using this template should remove the [first name] and replace it by the entry in the first name column of the entry to whom the email is being sent. This way we can send customized emails to a lot of people.",
